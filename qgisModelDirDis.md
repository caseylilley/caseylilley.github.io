## QGIS Model for Direction and Distance
In the first lab, we created a model to calculate direction and distance from a point. 
For our purposes, we calculated direction and distance of city tracts from a central business district. 
I then used this model to look at the distribution of median gross rent and race around the Seattle central business district. I found the CBD by finding the centroid of 3 census blocks located in downtown Seattle, and analyzed distance and direction from the CBD for all tracts in King County. You can view the [scatter plot](scatter_plot_distance.html) of distance and median gross rent, and the [polar plot]() of direction and median gross rent. There are also very interesting patterns in the racial distribution for distance and direction around the Seattle cbd. You can view a map here.
