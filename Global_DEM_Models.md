## Global Digital Elevation Models in Week 3

Using ASTER data Model V003 from the US and Japan, I conducted a basic terrain analysis around Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. This analysis was conducted on SAGA open source GIS. Below are the steps of analysis: creating an analytical hillshade visualization, detecting sinks and determining flow through them, removing sinks from the DEM by filling them, calculating flow accumulation, and mapping a channel network to show where streams are.
