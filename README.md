## Analyzing the Content and Spatial Distribution of Tweets about Hurricane Dorian: Real Storm Surge or Sharpie Maps?
In [lab 10](dorian2.md), we conducted an analysis of the content of twitter activity during Hurricane Dorian, and mapped the hotspots of activity to analyze whether the real path of the storm or President Trump's sharpie maps had more of an affect on tweets about the storm.

## Twitter Use Case - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Users' Sentiments Across Space
To learn more about the different uses and analyses of twitter data, I reviewed an [article](twittercase.md) investigating public sentiment across space using tweets.

## Vulnerability Analysis and Issues of Reproducability in GIS
For this [lab](vul.md), we attempted to reproduce an analysis conducted by Malcomb et al. on Malawi household climactic vulnerability. Our process revealed several issues in reproducibility and the importance of considering error and uncertainty, especially in the creation of social vulnerability indices. 

## Modeling Flood Resiliency in Dar Es Salaam Using OSM
By using data from the Resilience Academy and Ramani Huria, for Lab 6 I analyzed the density of buildings in each subward in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania located in a floodplain. Read more about the analysis and view the map online: [Resiliency in Dar Es Salaam](resiliencyDar.md)


## Using SAGA to Model Global Digital Elevation 
Using ASTER data, I visualized a hydrological landscape around Mount Kilimanjaro. Then I created a batch processing algorithm to automate the hydrological analysis and look for sources of error in SRTM and ASTER data: [Terrain Analysis](Global_DEM_Models.md)


## Modeling Distance and Direction in QGIS
Read more about how I built a model to show distance and direction of polygons from a point in QGIS for the first lab assignment:

## FOSS4G Conference Article Blog Post

Read my [article summary](foss4g.md) and review of a paper utilizing Open Source data for energy access planning in Tanzania to understand some of the interesting ways open software and open data sources make deeper analyses possible in GIS.
